# Django Bucket List Repository

Welcome to the **Django Bucket List** repository! This project is a web application built with Django that allows users to create and manage their bucket list items. A bucket list is a collection of goals, dreams, and experiences that a person aspires to accomplish in their lifetime. With this application, users can add, edit, and track their bucket list items, making it easier to stay focused on their life's objectives.

## Introduction

The Django Bucket List project is designed to help users organize and prioritize their bucket list items effectively. Users can create an account, log in, and start adding their desired goals.

The application aims to provide a user-friendly interface and a seamless experience in managing one's bucket list.

## Features
